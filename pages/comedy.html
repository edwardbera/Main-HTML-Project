            <h2>Death at a funeral</h2>
            <img src="../images/comedy/image-1.jpg" alt="Death at a funeral">
            <p>Aaron's father's funeral is today at the family home, and everything goes wrong: the funeral home delivers the wrong body;
               a cousin gives her fiancé a Valium from her brother's apartment, not knowing that her brother is dealing drugs--it's LSD 
               and the fiancé arrives at the funeral wildly stoned; Aaron's younger brother Ryan, a successful writer, flies in from 
               New York broke but arrogant; one uncle is angry over his daughter's choice of boyfriend and the other is cranky and coarse. 
               Add an ovulating wife, a jealous ex-boyfriend, and a short stranger who wants a word with Aaron--what could he want? 
               Would another death solve Aaron's problems? And what about the eulogy?</p>

            <h2>The Hangover</h2>
            <img src="../images/comedy/image-2.jpg" alt="The Hangover">
            <p>Angelenos Doug Billings and Tracy Garner are about to get married. Two days before the wedding, the four men in the wedding 
               party - Doug, Doug's two best buddies Phil Wenneck and Stu Price, and Tracy's brother Alan Garner - hop into Tracy's 
               father's beloved Mercedes convertible for a 24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher, has the 
               same maturity level as his students when he's with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what 
               his controlling girlfriend Melissa thinks. Because she disapproves of traditional male bonding rituals, Stu has to lie to 
               her about the stag, he telling her that they are going on a wine tasting tour in the Napa Valley. Regardless, he intends on 
               eventually marrying her, against the advice and wishes of his friends. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are considered 
               the social graces of the western world. The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each 
               with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain 
               things are in the suite that shouldn't be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most 
               important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of 
               information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened 
               to the missing items. However they are on a race for time as if they can't find Doug in the next few hours, they are going 
               to have to explain to Tracy why they are not yet back in Los Angeles. And even worse, they may not find Doug at all before 
               the wedding.</p>
