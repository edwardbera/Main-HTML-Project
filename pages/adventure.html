            <p>Once again we're plunged into the world of sword fights and "savvy" pirates. Captain Jack Sparrow is reminded he owes a 
               debt to Davy Jones, who captains the flying Dutchman, a ghostly ship, with a crew from hell. Facing the "locker" Jack 
               must find the heart of Davy Jones but to save himself he must get the help of quick-witted Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. 
               If that's not complicated enough, Will and Elizabeth are sentenced to hang, unless Will can get Lord Cutler Beckett Jack's 
               compass. Will is forced to join another crazy adventure with Jack.</p>

            <p>The orphaned heiress and intrepid archaeologist, Lara Croft, embarks on a dangerous quest to retrieve the two halves of
